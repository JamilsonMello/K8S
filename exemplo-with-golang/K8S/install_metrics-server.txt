go to the repository kubernetes sigs: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server

get the metrics with wget:
    
    => wget https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml

    and now, add to Deployment args the tag:

    => - --kubelet-insecure-tls

    => kubectl apply -f metrics-server.yaml

show services active:
    => kubectl get apiservices

    you can see the service metrics.k8s.io actived

## do this if you want working with "kind" in development environment
